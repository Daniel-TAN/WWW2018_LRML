## Latent Relational Metric Learning via Memory-based Attention for Collaborative Ranking

Implements a barebones reference implementation of the LRML model used in our WWW'18 experiments.

Note: Due to high volume of requests,
I am releasing this source code, (heavily cleaned to remove other irrelevant WIP models)
about 1+ years after I done the experiments. Please check the detailed comments in the model file.

## Reference

If you find our model useful, please consider citing our work.
